## 1st Commit

- Generated FlaskAPI script to load local csv and filter specific attributes of "AveragePrice" "Date" "TotalVolume" "region" "type" "year"

## 2nd Commit

- I want to visualize the average volume sold by month, in a line chart. One line will represent the 'organic' type, and the other line will represent the 'conventional' type. The x-axis will represent the time in months, and the y-axis will represent the volume, in a scaled format.

- Scaled route created : /average_volume_by_month_2015

## 3rd Commit

- Visualize a line chart showing the average price for 'conventional' & 'organic' avocados. I want the x-axis to represent all months of 2015. I want the y-axis to represent the price. I want the conventional line to be orange, and the organic line to be green.

- Route Created : /average_price_by_month_2015
